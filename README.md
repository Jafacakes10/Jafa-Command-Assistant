# Jafa-Command-Assistant
This is a Minetest mod to assist anyone with commands in game. It adds commands such as /day, /admin and /fly to make your Minetest experience easier.
## Possible uses
1. If you are a server admin, you will find this tool usefull as it allows you to control some of the most used player permissions, announce to all players without your nametag to stand out in chat and also control who has admin controls on your server.

2. If you are just playing with friends, the commands such as /fly, /tp and /day might be usefull for letting people fly, shortening the teleport command and setting the time to day without extensive knowledge of commands.

3. If you are playing singleplayer then the /fly or /admin command will be usefull to allow you to have full control of your world.

4. If you are a teacher at a school using Minetest with pupils to easily controll permissions and what they can do.
